# ArcheryScoreBoard

This is the Git page of my Scoreboard and tournament manager for archery

this includes a bracketed tour, with or without ranking tournament

also freemode, and standard 25, 30, 50 and 72 arrow games

the goal is for it to be saved either by log, csv or sql database, with hash to verify results.
